Here are my VSCode extension packs üß∞. Each of them are focus on some domain in development except the core-pack.
The reason why I made my own extension packs is mainly for keep VSCode in blazing fast status.

Enjoy youself with these packs, and feel free to fork and made your every own packs. üëç
